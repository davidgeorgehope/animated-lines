# TODO
At the moment the lines are really annoying, they can't be deleted, they can't be moved much. 

Cut/Paste? 

Be nice to be able to set transparency for the colors. 

The opacity thing doesn't seem to really maintain state between object selections. Bit random.

Other Shapes?

Other line types? Bendy lines etc.
