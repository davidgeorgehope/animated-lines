Cut/Paste? 

Other Shapes?

Other line types? Bendy lines etc.

Arrow head thickness is a bit weird. 

ROTATE

Undo, redo?

Remove White->Remove whatever color i set using the pipette.

If i connect two boxes with two lines I might want the line to go around the side, be good to have a few points on the line where I can pull it/adjust it.
